1. Time complexity analysis of LRU Cache algorithm
   - Both write in cache read from cache is O(n) because of searching if the key is exist in the Linked List data structure which is used for finding Least Recent Used item
2. Space complexity analysis of LRU Cache algorithm
    Spaced used for Map is determined and Linked List data structure is also using extra memory for creating an efficient cache algorithm. But the space is determined so it is A(1)
