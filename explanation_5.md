This problem also make me very delightfull because of blockchain was very complex thing for me before and I understand now that it is very simple
1. Time complexity analysis of Blockchain 
 - append to blockchain is O(1) except with the cyrptography algorithm we used in the chain since it is  only a special linkedlist

2. Space complexity analysis of Blockchain
 - with data itself there is 256 bit hash data and timestamp information is occupy space A(3n)
