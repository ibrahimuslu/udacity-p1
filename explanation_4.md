1. Time complexity analysis of finding if the user in group
 - its independent from the given parameters number of times and it is only dependent of the group depth so it is in O(1) complexity
 2. Space complexity analysis of finding if the user in group
 - the same and not dependent on the parameters given but to fixed number of depth of the groups
